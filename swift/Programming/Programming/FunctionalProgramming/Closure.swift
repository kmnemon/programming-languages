     A closure that is called after the function it was supplied to returns is referred to as an escaping closure. It outlives the function it was supplied to, in other words. The completion handler is an illustration of an escaping closure. A completion handler is often run in the future, depending on how it is implemented. When a task takes a long time to finish, the closure escapes and outlives the purpose for which it was designed. An escaping closure can be thought of as code that outlives the function it was provided into. Imagine that function as a prison, and the closure as a bandit breaking out of the prison.

     A closure that is called inside the function it was supplied into, that is, before it returns, is referred to as a non-escaping closure.

The passed closure in this case no longer exists in memory once the closure has been executed and execution has concluded since it has left the scope. During the course of their lifetime, non-escaping closures change into different states.
