//2. insert suspension point
/*
 Assuming the code that renders video is synchronous, it doesnâ€™t contain any suspension points. The work to render video could also take a long time. However, you can periodically call Task.yield() to explicitly add suspension points. Structuring long-running code this way lets Swift balance between making progress on this task, and letting other tasks in your program make progress on their work.
